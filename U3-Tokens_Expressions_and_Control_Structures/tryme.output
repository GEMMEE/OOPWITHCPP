This program will wait for the user's input and takes any input entered and
wait for another input on a new line and then it goes on like this 
indefinitely till you end the program by ctrl ^ c.

For example, when run, it waits for input:
>3  //user entered 3
>4  //user entered 4
>5  //user entered 5
>1  //user entered 6
>8  //user entered 8
>623  //user entered 623
>     //wait for another input and and it goes on unless you end it 
.	  //using ctrl + C
.
.
Honestly, I did not understand how this is working! And I can't wait to 
learn what is going on under the hood. Will update this when I get the
hint!
